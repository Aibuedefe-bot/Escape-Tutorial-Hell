# Escape-Tutorial-Hell
Escape Tutorial Hell: A Project-Driven Journey in Data Science and MLOps  This repo is a collection of small, hands-on projects to help me — and any junior dev — escape tutorial hell. The goal: stop consuming content and start building. Each project applies key data science and MLOps concepts, pushing you to write code and learn by doing.
