# About This Repository

This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects designed to help me â€” and any junior developer â€” break free from the endless cycle of tutorials. The goal is simple: stop passively consuming content and start building.

Each project focuses on applying key concepts in data science and MLOps, from basic data analysis to deploying machine learning models. Whether you're stuck in tutorial hell or just looking to solidify your skills, these projects will push you to write code, solve problems, and learn by doing.

Letâ€™s move from 'watching' to 'creating' â€” one project at a time. ðŸš€

# How to Use This Repo

Pick a project â€” Start small and work your way up.

Build first, Google later â€” Try coding without tutorials, and only check docs or Stack Overflow when stuck.

Customize and expand â€” Add features, test new ideas, and make the project your own.

Document your learnings â€” Each project has a README where you can explain what you did, what you learned, and any challenges faced.
